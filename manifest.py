"""The sidecar that says how `lora_train_data.jsonl` was made. Pure, no torch.

preprocess.py writes `lora_train_data.meta.json` next to its output. Every profile reads the same training file, so
without it a model can silently be trained on the wrong prompt (Hy trained on TranslateGemma's instruction), or on a
file edited after it was cleaned. update_dataset_info.py and train.py check it first; the same record is what the
experiment tracker logs as the run's data fingerprint.
