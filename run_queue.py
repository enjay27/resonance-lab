"""The local record of every run, written before anything is sent to the MLflow server. No network, no mlflow.

An append-only journal (`.run.result.backup.jsonl`, one JSON object per line) holds everything. A run is a `run` line (its
header: experiment, name, start), a `remote` line once the server has created it, and `event` lines in the order the
stages recorded them (params, tags, metrics, a trainer log, an artifact, the final status). Once the server has an event,
a `sent` line acknowledges it (a failed optional upload is a `fail` line with its try count). So a run made while the NAS
was off, or a sync that stopped halfway, is simply the events that are still unacknowledged: tracker.sync replays them
as a queue, oldest run first, without sending anything twice. Small files are copied into
`.run.result.backup.files/<run>/<event id>-<name>` so the originals may be deleted.

Every write appends one line (nothing already written is touched), so a crash leaves at worst one torn last line, which
is ignored, and two processes writing at once (a training and an eval) lose nothing. State is read by replaying the file.
At each start the journal is compacted: acknowledged events are dropped with their copied files; the run header and the
server's id stay (a later stage resumes the run by them, and the id stops a run from being created twice), until
`prune` forgets old finished runs. Compaction is an atomic temp-file replace and is skipped, to be retried next time,
when the file cannot be replaced (another process has it open on Windows).
