# workflow-control

Four steps, in order. Do not skip ahead.

## 1 · Plan (no edits)

- Locate the code with graft (the `code-graph` account skill), not by reading whole files:
  `g ask "<task>" --source`, `g skeleton <file>`.
- For every symbol you will move, rename, split or change the signature of, run
  `g callers <sym> --depth all`. For a `config.py` constant, `g grep "<NAME>"`.
  List the files it reaches — that is the impact.
- Say which part(s) are touched (data / model, per `CLAUDE.md`) and therefore which gate
  applies, and whether this session can run it (no GPU here: the model part cannot run).
- Say whether the change reaches resonance-stream (prompt, chat template, data fields).
- Present: what changes, what does not, the impact list, the gate, the commit(s).

## 2 · Approval

Wait for explicit confirmation. Approval of a plan covers the steps in it, nothing more.
A new step discovered mid-way that widens scope goes back to the developer.

## 3 · Execute

- One task at a time. Refactors are behaviour-preserving: move first, change later,
  never both in one commit.
- Test first (CLAUDE.md *Guardrails*): the failing test, then the code.
- After each move, re-run `g callers` on the moved symbol and confirm every caller
  imports the new path.
- At most **2** self-corrections on a failing gate; then stop and report.

## 4 · Verify and commit

- Run `just check`. Report exactly what ran and what could not.
- Record state on the issue (a `cmd:` label) and update the relevant `.memory/` file.
- Work on a `claude/<task>` branch; commit as often as useful, code and memory together,
  per `CLAUDE.md` *Version Control*.
  Unrun checks go in the last commit body as `NOT VERIFIED: ...`. Green gate → push the
  branch and open a PR; CI auto-merges it.
