"""The stages' use of the experiment tracker, so the model-part scripts stay a few lines each. No torch, no mlflow.

Every function takes the tracker (`tracker.from_environment()`: a `Tracker`, or a `NullTracker` when tracking is off) and
never raises into a stage: the tracker's own calls are guarded, and a stage that finds no run to continue records nothing.
Training starts a run; merge, GGUF and eval continue it (`resume_stage`) by the run id their record names (track_records.py).
